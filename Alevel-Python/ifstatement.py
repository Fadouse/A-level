# Hi! in this py file , i will teach you a simple if statement
# In any if statement, its head seems like this if boolean :
# The boolean will decide if the code will go in to if body.

# like here the boolean value is false, so code won't go in to if body.
if False:
    print("Immpossible to see this output")

# If the boolean i ture, the code will go in to if body.
if True:
    print("100% to see this output")

# boolean have to value {True / False}
